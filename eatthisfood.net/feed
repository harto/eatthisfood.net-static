<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It’s been said that Melbourne is a land of milk and honey.</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">And I’m pretty sure that’s not a reference to the 1984 John and Yoko</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">album of the same name. There’s no doubt it’s always becoming easier</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">to seek out interesting and unique products, made by people who have</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a real connection with what they sell. Products like the honey hailing</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">from the rooftops of the Melbourne CBD, made by a group of committed</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">honey enthusiasts using old fashioned methods, producing old fashioned</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">honey that actually tastes AMAZING. And milk from Jonesy’s, a business</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">that’s part of a mini-revolution of sorts at the moment. Their products</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">promise superior quality; happier cows and happier farmers.</span></p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484" title="cake1" alt="" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cake1.png" width="645" height="432" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">In order to achieve the layers in this cake, it’s essential to bake two<br />
sheets of cake which will require you to bake two separate batches. You<br />
will end up with a LOT of off cuts, they are for experimenting with, or<br />
freezing for a rainy day. You will also require two cake rings, one with a<br />
diameter of 125mm, and another 205mm. In addition to these you WILL need<br />
acetate plastic film, available from art supply shops. Feel free to go down<br />
your own path with different shaped cake rings too, square shapes would<br />
look really neat, as a suggestion.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Before preparing the cake batter, line a 17 cm by 12 cm lamington tray<br />
with baking paper. Preheat the oven to 180C.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Begin by sifting the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Separate the eggs. Using a stand alone mixer on high speed, with a beater<br />
attachment, whip the egg whites into stiff peaks. Rain in the sugar at the<br />
end of this process and you should have a glossy stark white meringue.<br />
Using a paddle attachment, mix on low speed incorporating the egg yolks,<br />
one at a time. Keep the mixer on low and add ⅓ of the remaining dry<br />
ingredients. Alternate with ⅓ of the buttermilk until everything is well<br />
incorporated. Try not to over-mix, you want to keep the volume of the egg<br />
whites without knocking too much air out of it.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Take this cake batter and pour into the lamington tin, smoothing the top<br />
with a spatula. Let it sit for 5 minutes on a flat surface, as you want the<br />
cake to rise as evenly as possible.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Pop it in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the top has turned a lovely<br />
golden colour, and the middle springs back when poked. The cake should<br />
have risen slightly too. If all is looking good, remove from the oven and<br />
let cool for just a few minutes. Grab a fork and prick the cake all over.<br />
Mix together the ingredients of the milky soak, and pour on top of the<br />
cake. Allow to cool for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Now comes the fun part &#8211; grab the cake ring and cut out two large circles<br />
and two smaller ones. Put the cake circles in a safe place while you mix<br />
another batter, and bake another tray.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Once you have baked and cut out another tray of cake, gather your circles<br />
together and put your cake rings on some baking paper, atop of a flat<br />
wooden chopping board, or anything else that’s flat and will be ok to go<br />
into the freezer. Using the acetate, line each cake ring on the inside.<br />
The acetate will need to be high enough to support three layers of cake<br />
with frosting, which will probably be about a cm or two thick in between<br />
each layer.</p>
<p class="wpGallery"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-485" title="cake2" alt="" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cake2.png" width="851" height="380" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">For the frosting, start by creaming the butter and cream cheese together<br />
in a stand alone mixer with paddle attachment. While this is happening,<br />
melt the vegetable shortening in a pot on the stove or in the microwave.<br />
Once the cream cheese and butter are light and voluptuous, add the melted<br />
shortening a little at a time, mixing on a medium to high speed. Turn the<br />
mixer down to low and stream in the glucose and vanilla. Crank the mixer<br />
back up for another 2-3 minutes. Finally add the sugar and baking powder<br />
and mix on low speed until completely incorporated. Flick the mixer back<br />
up again to high, until the frosting is smooth and white.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Layer your cake by slotting in the first cake circle, followed by a layer<br />
of frosting. Repeat until you have three layers of cake, and three layers<br />
of frosting. Do the same with the smaller cake ring.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Put everything into the freezer for 12 hours so that the cake can<br />
properly set. Once you have done this, pop the cake ring off, and<br />
carefully unwrap the acetate. Viola! Your cake will be ready, and stable<br />
enough for you to stack the small one on top of the bigger one. Let the<br />
whole thing thaw in the fridge for an hour or two before serving.</p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #000080;">Baked eggs tend to get a bad rap. And although there are a few bad versions</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">floating around, it is possible to cook eggs to perfection in the oven and</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">accompany with some pretty exciting flavors. This recipe comes from an Aussie</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">expat living in California, who has spent time getting down in the kitchen with</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">some genuine Mexican crew. It’s the real deal, and recommended as a lively</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">way to get your Saturday morning kick started. It’s also a great way to use up</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">corn chips, or tortilla from the night before. Enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><a href="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-27-at-9.26.45-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-538" title="Screen Shot 2013-02-27 at 9.26.45 PM" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-27-at-9.26.45-PM.png" alt="" width="485" height="689" /></a></p>
<p class="wpGallery">Preheat oven to 180C</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Soak the chiles in boiling water in a bowl for at least half an hour until they&#8217;re soft<br />
(try to keep them entirely submerged the whole time). When they&#8217;re soft, tear out the<br />
stems and remove seeds. Strain and set aside the water they were soaking in. Using a food<br />
processer, blend the chiles, garlic, about a cup of water and some salt. It should be<br />
reasonably smooth and not too thick.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Next up, coat the bottom of a frying pan in sunflower oil and heat well. Add the capsicum,<br />
onion and zucchini. Sauté for about 2 minutes, add spices, and continue cooking on high heat<br />
for another few minutes. Pour the chile sauce over the vegetables, and add a little bit more<br />
oil, plus a tiny bit more salt, the sugar and the tomato paste. Stir well for a couple of<br />
minutes. Slowly add the tortilla/chips, stirring the whole time. Taste for salt, you may<br />
need to add some more.It should have a fairly spicy kick to it.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Using an appropriate dish to bake eggs in, fill with the tortilla and tomato mixture,<br />
leaving enough room to crack an egg into.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Crack an egg in, and throw in a generous handful of cheese. Crack some black pepper over<br />
the top. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes of so, or until the egg is just set and the filling<br />
is piping hot. Finish with freshly chopped coriander.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">*Also you may need to hunt down some of these ingredients, if you’re in Melbourne,<br />
Casa Iberica and USA foods will be of great help to you.</p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #f4c300;">There’s something pretty special about a cherry pie. It’s delicious for one.</span><br />
<span style="color: #f4c300;"> It’s also iconic, having starred in many a TV show as well as some truly awful</span><br />
<span style="color: #f4c300;"> 90’s music. Dousing a cherry pie with brandy cream turns this diner classic</span><br />
<span style="color: #f4c300;"> into a festive treat. The perfect end to a lazy lunch in the afternoon heat.</span><br />
<span style="color: #f4c300;"> Merry Christmas to all!</span></p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-501" title="ChristmasPie2a,jpg" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ChristmasPie2ajpg.png" alt="" width="490" height="1091" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter">Start with the pastry. Mix the sugar and plain flour together well with a<br />
pinch of salt. Rub the butter into the dry mixture well with your hands<br />
until the butter is completely broken up and incorporated.<br />
Using a fork, mix well while adding the vinegar and water. Continue to add<br />
small amounts of water until the dough comes together. Use your hands to<br />
lightly bring it together and wrap in cling film tightly. Rest the pastry<br />
in the fridge for two hours.</p>
<p>For the filling, pit the cherries and combine well with the sugar, egg<br />
yolks and flour. Let sit for 10 minutes and drain off half of the liquid.<br />
Take the pastry out of the fridge and roll out to a .5cm thickness. Line<br />
the pie tin with pastry. Also roll out a second circle of pastry for the<br />
top of the pie. Reserve the offcuts for a second pie, or another sweet<br />
treat. Add the filling to the pie and run some eggwash around the edges.<br />
Lastly, crumble the ricotta into the filling.</p>
<p>Attach the top circle of pastry and bake for 30 &#8211; 40 minutes until the pie<br />
is cooked, and golden.</p>
<p>For the brandy cream, whip the cream until it is lightly beaten. Add egg<br />
yolks, sugar and brandy and beat well. Taste and increase the booze if<br />
needed.</p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #f5096c;">The precise history of corned beef is not too clear, but somewhere<br />
along</span><span style="color: #f5096c;"> the line the Irish have claimed at least some credit for this</span><br />
<span style="color: #f5096c;"> criminally underrated cured meat. Particularly those Irish folk who</span><br />
<span style="color: #f5096c;"> emigrated to America, where corned beef is scoffed down with much</span><br />
<span style="color: #f5096c;"> enthusiasm on St Paddy’s day alongside spuds, boiled</span><span style="color: #f5096c;"> cabbage<br />
and bacon. Here we’ve decided to swap the cabbage and</span><span style="color: #f5096c;"> bacon for<br />
brussel sprouts and pancetta. We’ve also traded the pint of</span><br />
<span style="color: #f5096c;"> Guinness for a long neck of Melbourne Bitter, as it’s got just the</span><br />
<span style="color: #f5096c;"> right amount of sting to see you returning your knife and fork very</span><br />
<span style="color: #f5096c;"> quickly to that delicious, delicious meat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395" title="cornedbeef3" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cornedbeef3.png" alt="" width="294" height="390" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">The corned beef will take a couple of hours, so begin with this.<br />
Trim the beef of any messy bits of fat, and give a quick rinse under<br />
cold water. Place in a pot and cover with cold water.  Throw in the<br />
carrots, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns and onion. Bring to a boil<br />
and simmer for a couple of hours, or until the beef is easily<br />
pierced with a knife. Keep an eye on it as you’ll have to<br />
top up the water every so often.</p>
<p>For the sprouts, bring a pot of well salted water to the boil.<br />
Blanch them for 2 minutes and remove and rinse under some cold water<br />
until cool. Dice the pancetta and fry in a very hot pan until crispy.<br />
Set them aside, lower the heat slightly and saute the onion and garlic until<br />
translucent. Remove the onion and garlic from the pan, turn the heat back<br />
up and put the half of the sprouts in flat side down and caramlise the<br />
outside a little. Watch that you don&#8217;t crowd the pan otherwise you<br />
won&#8217;t get the lovely colour on the outside. Once the sprouts have all<br />
had a turn in the pan, combine all the ingredients and throw in a generous<br />
knob of salted butter until everything is combined and shiny.</p>
<p>For the spuds, quarter them and cook in salted water until soft.<br />
Mash with generous amounts of cream, salt and white pepper.<br />
Once tasting great, whip in a generous knob of butter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396" title="cornedbeef4" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cornedbeef4.png" alt="" width="312" height="306" /></p>
<p>For the white sauce, melt the 50g of butter in a pot and add the 50g of<br />
plain flour. Whilst stirring with a wooden spoon, cook for 2 minutes on<br />
it’s own. Take off the heat, and add 300mls of full cream milk. Put back<br />
on heat and keep the mixture moving. If the sauce is too thick, use some of<br />
the stock from the corned beef to thin it out a little. It will need to be<br />
seasoned well with salt and pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>

<p><span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">What to do with a pumpkin? Pumpkin soup is nice, but a sweet</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">pumpkin pie is better. Winter is the perfect time for sourcing and</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">baking a pumpkin; the organic beauty we got to make this pie was</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">just $1.80 a kg. Melding it with sugar, oats, cream, and ginger nut</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">biscuits makes for a luscious dessert or a wicked afternoon snack.</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">This pie is loosely based on the notorious “Crack Pie”, found at the</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">Momofuku Milk Bar in NYC. And if you haven’t heard of that,</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">hop onto google cause chances are you haven’t fully come</span><br />
<span class="etf-alternate-font" style="color: #800080;">to appreciate the power of the PIE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375" title="PUMPKINREC" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/PUMPKINREC.png" alt="" width="449" height="415" /></p>
<p>Begin by roasting the pumpkin and letting it cool. Take half a pumpkin,<br />
and chop it into decent sized chunks. Wrap tightly in foil and bake in<br />
a moderate oven until the pumpkin is cooked completely through and soft.<br />
Use these segments to make your pumpkin puree by blitzing them in a food<br />
processor or blender until very smooth.</p>
<p>For the pie crust, combine the ginger snap biscuits, rolled oats, a tbsp<br />
of sugar and a pinch of baking powder in a food processor. Pulse until<br />
fine breadcrumb consistency. Tip into a mixing bowl and pour over 120 g of<br />
melted butter. Incorporate well and press the mixture evenly into a pie<br />
tin of your choice.</p>
<p>For the filling, combine the sugars, salt, milk powder and cornflour in a<br />
mixer with a paddle attachment and mix until incorporated. Add the melted<br />
butter with the speed on low for a couple of minutes until the mixture<br />
is moist. Keep mixing on low and add the pumpkin until well combined.<br />
Finally, add the egg yolks, one at a time until smooth and glossy.<br />
Pour the filling into the pie crust and bake in an oven on 160C for 15<br />
minutes. Hopefully by this stage the pie will have begun to set around the<br />
outside. Now open the door and keep it ajar with a wooden spoon while the<br />
middle sets a bit more. Keep it like this for another 10 minutes then turn<br />
the oven off and let the pie cool in the oven. It won’t completely set in<br />
the middle but that’s ok, it will firm up when cool.</p>

Milk jam (dulce de leche) is a guaranteed food high. It’ll send</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">an otherwise reasonable person weak at the knees, scrambling for</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">extra spoonfuls out of the jar. Powerful stuff. And great on pancakes.</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">These pancakes are kind of halfway between the fluffy</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> American<br />
style and the super thin French crepe. Fluffy enough to stack</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">up on a plate, but still thin enough to wrap around your fork.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" title="pancakes1" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pancakes1.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="418" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">Combine dry ingredients. Make a well in the centre, and add the eggs.<br />
Mix in the milk and water until smooth. Cling wrap this mixture and leave<br />
it in the fridge overnight, for at least 12 hours. The longer you leave<br />
it, the better. When it comes to cooking, incorporate the melted butter,<br />
and free up with a little water if the mix is too thick. It should look<br />
smooth and glossy. Cook in a hot pan with extra melted butter.</p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-341" title="pancakes2" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pancakes2.png" alt="" width="522" height="201" /></p>
<p class="aligncenter"><span class="wpGallery">For Milk Jam, combine 1 litre of good quality cows milk with 800g of</span><br />
<span class="wpGallery">caster sugar. Heat on the stove and simmer very gently for 4 &#8211; 5 hours,</span><br />
<span class="wpGallery">stirring every half an hour to prevent a skin forming on top.</span><br />
<span class="wpGallery">Lastly, the strawberries. Bring a sugar syrup to the boil with a vanilla</span><br />
<span class="wpGallery">pod, halved. Throw a punnet of strawberries in and allow to cool in the</span><br />
<span class="wpGallery">liquid. Remove strawberries and reduce by half. Once cooled completely</span><br />
<span class="wpGallery">once again add the strawberries to the syrup, and store in the fridge.</span></p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="font-size: large; color: #008000;">The amazing thing about silken tofu is its soft jelly like texture.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large; color: #008000;"> It’s very fragile to work with, but somehow holds together perfectly</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fry the tofu, heat a wok or large saucepan with peanut oil to 160C.<br />
Carefully lower segments of tofu into the hot oil and fry for around<br />
3 or 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Arrange the salad as you wish. Thin segments are good.<br />
Make sure everything is washed really well.<br />
Use some soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and lemon juice to create<br />
a tasty dipping condiment. Top plentifully with spring onions.</p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #000080;">Wagyu beef comes from a deluxe breed of cattle that yields meat</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">prized for its rich, marbled quality. It’s quality stuff that costs a little</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">bit more, but makes for some pretty amazing eating. The good thing</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">about choosing a less sought after cut of wagyu is that it becomes</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">a little bit more affordable. Beef cheeks work extra well in a pie,</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">as there’s nothing like good quality meat cooked in extra buttery</span><br />
<span style="color: #000080;">pastry! And loads of tomato sauce, of course. Gimme.</span></p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289" title="pies3" src="http://eatthisfood.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pies3.png" alt="" width="582" height="428" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">Start by sweating the onion, garlic, carrots, celery, leek, and star<br />
anise in a large pot for about 10 minutes. Remove from the pot. Turn up the<br />
heat and caramelise the mushroom until golden, for around 5 minutes.<br />
Take the mushrooms out and add a splash of water to the pot to deglaze.<br />
Add this liquid to the vegetables.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Prepare the beef cheeks by cutting away any large bits of fat and sinew,<br />
and chop into small bite size pieces. Return the pot to the heat, and<br />
some more oil and throw the beef cheeks in a few pieces at a time to<br />
brown up well. Set the meat aside and deglaze the pot with a hefty<br />
splash of brandy and 250mls of red wine.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Once the liquid has reduced by half and the alcohol burnt off, add the<br />
tin of tomatoes, 3 sprigs of thyme, a bay leaf, the beef cheek, and the<br />
vegetables. If there’s not enough liquid to cover the meat, add a little<br />
water. Put a lid on and simmer on a low heat until the meat is tender<br />
but not falling apart. This should take anywhere between 2 &#8211; 3 hours.<br />
Once the mixture is cooked, remove the beef cheek, set aside, and strain<br />
the vegetables from the liquid. Put the liquid back on the heat and<br />
reduce by half. Add the meat back to the liquid and season rigorously<br />
with salt, white pepper, and a few splashes of malt vinegar.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">This mix will make enough for about a dozen small party pies.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">For the pastry, use the shortcrust for the bottom of the pies.<br />
Allow the pastry to rest for 30 minutes after you’ve lined the pie<br />
molds. Use puff pastry for the top of the pies. Glaze with egg wash<br />
and bake in 180C oven for 20 &#8211; 30 minutes, or until the pastry<br />
is golden and cooked through.</p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Beef ribs are highly underrated. And cheap. They require some </span><br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">patience when cooking, but their amazing depth of flavour and beautiful </span><br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">gelatinous texture  make the results totally worth it. This will taste great </span><br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">with barbecued corn on the cob and some fresh lime wedges to cut through </span><br />
<span style="color: #ff6600;">the richness of the meat.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21" title="bsr3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bsr3.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="499" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Turn the oven on to 150 ºC. Trim off any unwanted bits of fat and season the ribs very well,<br />
giving them a good massage with olive oil and plenty of sea salt and cracked pepper. Place<br />
them in a baking dish with the quartered onions, broken-up garlic, bay leaves and some<br />
peppercorns. Top the dish up a couple of centimetres with chicken stock. Cook for up to 4<br />
hours, turning over the ribs after 2½ hours to make sure there’s still liquid in the bottom of the<br />
tray, and topping up with water or more chicken stock if it’s drying out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54" title="BeefShortLOW-1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BeefShortLOW-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="560" /></p>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">For the chimichuri, combine all ingredients and season to taste with salt and lime juice.<br />
And finally, for the barbecued corn, blanch the corn cobs briefly in salted boiling water and cook<br />
on a very hot barbecue or griddle. Brush down with butter throughout the cooking process.</p>

<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #cc9966;">The holy grail of sweet, eggy, fluffy and crunchy goodness.</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc9966;">People obsess over good versions of these tarts, and rightly so.</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc9966;">The base should be thin, crunchy and slightly flaky, while the inside</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc9966;">remains sweet and fluffy with a dark caramelisation on top.</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc9966;">No soggy or chewy pastry, please.</span></p>

<p class="wpGallery">For the pastry base, roll the puff pastry up lengthways,<br />
like a fruit Roll-Up. Chill for 20 minutes then slice the pastry into<br />
1 cm slices and spread them out into small pastry moulds.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">For the custard filling, whisk the flour and ¼ cup of the milk in a medium<br />
bowl until smooth, then set aside. Heat the sugar, cinnamon and water<br />
in a small saucepan until just boiling. Meanwhile, bring the remaining<br />
1 cup of milk to the boil in another small saucepan then remove quickly<br />
from the heat. Whisk the hot milk into the flour mixture. Next, remove<br />
the cinnamon stick and pour the sugar syrup in a thin stream into the<br />
mixture, whisking briskly. Add the vanilla and stir for a minute until<br />
very warm but not hot. Finally, whisk in the yolks.<br />
Pour the custard into the pastry shells and cook for 15 minutes or so,<br />
or until the tops are dark and caramelised.<br />
Allow to cool slightly while preparing yourself a coffee.</p>

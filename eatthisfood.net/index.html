<p class="etf-alternate-font"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It’s been said that Melbourne is a land of milk and honey.</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">And I’m pretty sure that’s not a reference to the 1984 John and Yoko</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">album of the same name. There’s no doubt it’s always becoming easier</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">to seek out interesting and unique products, made by people who have</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a real connection with what they sell. Products like the honey hailing</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">from the rooftops of the Melbourne CBD, made by a group of committed</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">honey enthusiasts using old fashioned methods, producing old fashioned</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">honey that actually tastes AMAZING. And milk from Jonesy’s, a business</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">that’s part of a mini-revolution of sorts at the moment. Their products</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">promise superior quality; happier cows and happier farmers.</span></p>
<p class="etf-alternate-font"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484" title="cake1" alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cake1.png" width="645" height="432" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">In order to achieve the layers in this cake, it’s essential to bake two<br />
sheets of cake which will require you to bake two separate batches. You<br />
will end up with a LOT of off cuts, they are for experimenting with, or<br />
freezing for a rainy day. You will also require two cake rings, one with a<br />
diameter of 125mm, and another 205mm. In addition to these you WILL need<br />
acetate plastic film, available from art supply shops. Feel free to go down<br />
your own path with different shaped cake rings too, square shapes would<br />
look really neat, as a suggestion.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Before preparing the cake batter, line a 17 cm by 12 cm lamington tray<br />
with baking paper. Preheat the oven to 180C.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Begin by sifting the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Separate the eggs. Using a stand alone mixer on high speed, with a beater<br />
attachment, whip the egg whites into stiff peaks. Rain in the sugar at the<br />
end of this process and you should have a glossy stark white meringue.<br />
Using a paddle attachment, mix on low speed incorporating the egg yolks,<br />
one at a time. Keep the mixer on low and add ⅓ of the remaining dry<br />
ingredients. Alternate with ⅓ of the buttermilk until everything is well<br />
incorporated. Try not to over-mix, you want to keep the volume of the egg<br />
whites without knocking too much air out of it.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Take this cake batter and pour into the lamington tin, smoothing the top<br />
with a spatula. Let it sit for 5 minutes on a flat surface, as you want the<br />
cake to rise as evenly as possible.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Pop it in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the top has turned a lovely<br />
golden colour, and the middle springs back when poked. The cake should<br />
have risen slightly too. If all is looking good, remove from the oven and<br />
let cool for just a few minutes. Grab a fork and prick the cake all over.<br />
Mix together the ingredients of the milky soak, and pour on top of the<br />
cake. Allow to cool for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Now comes the fun part &#8211; grab the cake ring and cut out two large circles<br />
and two smaller ones. Put the cake circles in a safe place while you mix<br />
another batter, and bake another tray.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Once you have baked and cut out another tray of cake, gather your circles<br />
together and put your cake rings on some baking paper, atop of a flat<br />
wooden chopping board, or anything else that’s flat and will be ok to go<br />
into the freezer. Using the acetate, line each cake ring on the inside.<br />
The acetate will need to be high enough to support three layers of cake<br />
with frosting, which will probably be about a cm or two thick in between<br />
each layer.</p>
<p class="wpGallery"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-485" title="cake2" alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cake2.png" width="851" height="380" /></p>
<p class="wpGallery">For the frosting, start by creaming the butter and cream cheese together<br />
in a stand alone mixer with paddle attachment. While this is happening,<br />
melt the vegetable shortening in a pot on the stove or in the microwave.<br />
Once the cream cheese and butter are light and voluptuous, add the melted<br />
shortening a little at a time, mixing on a medium to high speed. Turn the<br />
mixer down to low and stream in the glucose and vanilla. Crank the mixer<br />
back up for another 2-3 minutes. Finally add the sugar and baking powder<br />
and mix on low speed until completely incorporated. Flick the mixer back<br />
up again to high, until the frosting is smooth and white.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Layer your cake by slotting in the first cake circle, followed by a layer<br />
of frosting. Repeat until you have three layers of cake, and three layers<br />
of frosting. Do the same with the smaller cake ring.</p>
<p class="wpGallery">Put everything into the freezer for 12 hours so that the cake can<br />
properly set. Once you have done this, pop the cake ring off, and<br />
carefully unwrap the acetate. Viola! Your cake will be ready, and stable<br />
enough for you to stack the small one on top of the bigger one. Let the<br />
whole thing thaw in the fridge for an hour or two before serving.</p>
